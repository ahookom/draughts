# draughts
The classic game of checkers, playable as a two-player game or against an AI (command-line, Linux terminal)

The game uses UTF-8 unicode characters for chess pieces, and works best in a terminal set to dark text on a light background with large font (>20).

**This code has only been tested in XFCE terminal in Ubuntu Linux.**
